# Text file(p22_names.txt) containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into
# alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
# multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth
# 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would
# obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
